sdl2-ttf
========

Haskell bindings for the True Type Font library for SDL.

- libsdl <https://www.libsdl.org>
- sdl2-ttf <https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/>

I am not the original author of this library, credit for that goes
to @osa1. Their version was dependent on a different implementation
of Haskell SDL2 bindings.

Pull requests, suggestions, advice, feature requests are all invited!

Forked again by [carldong](https://github.com/carldong) to codevelop with their
`timeless-SDL` project, and hopefully make it really high level. They're also
responsible for the upgrade to SDL2 >= 2 ! Cheers !!
