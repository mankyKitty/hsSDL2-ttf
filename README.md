sdl2-ttf
========

Haskell bindings for the True Type Font library for SDL.

- libsdl <https://www.libsdl.org>
- sdl2-ttf <https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/>

I am not the original author of this library, credit for that goes
to @osa1 and @mankyKitty. Their version was dependent on a different implementation
of Haskell SDL2 bindings.

I forked `sdl2-ttf` haskell binding again to codevelop with my
`timeless-SDL` project, and hopefully make it really high level
